This project aims to develop a machine learning-based model to estimate the fuel efficiency of automobiles using the automobile_performance.csv dataset. The dataset comprises entirely numerical features—including cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year—all relevant to predicting miles per gallon (MPG). Since the dataset contains no missing or categorical values, preprocessing steps such as imputation or label encoding are unnecessary. However, to enhance model robustness and mitigate the impact of extreme values, outliers are detected and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Feature scaling is then applied via standardization to ensure all features operate on a comparable scale, improving the performance of gradient-sensitive algorithms.

Three regression models are employed: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. Linear Regression serves as a baseline due to its simplicity and interpretability, while the tree-based models are used to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio. Model performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score. This approach aims to yield an accurate and interpretable predictor for automobile fuel efficiency, with potential applications in vehicle design optimization, regulatory assessments, and consumer decision-making.
